The idea of formalization of reasoning starts from the middle ages and reached its maturity in modern logic that is in Frege → Peano → Russell and Whitehead → Hubert → Lukasiewicz → Gödel → Tarski → Jaśkowski → Leśniewski etc.

Elimination of quantifiers results in reducing whole of logic into binary algebra.

Formalization of logic effectively resulted in us pursuing inquiry into the nature of intelligence by providing us a suitable base.
