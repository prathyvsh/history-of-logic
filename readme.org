*** [[https://www.elsevier.com/books/book-series/handbook-of-the-history-of-logic][Handbook of Logic]]
A multivolume series with scholarship in the history of logic

*** [[http://www.columbia.edu/%7Eav72/papers/JANCL_2003.pdf][The Geometry of Negation]]
Negation as a rotation of polygons/polyhedra. Also gives a brief survey of different kinds of logic systems and the kind of group actions implicit in their structures.
