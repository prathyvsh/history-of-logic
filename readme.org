** Notes

There seems to be a link between how Kempe influenced Peirce, both influenced Royce, which ends up influencing Sheffer in arriving at his “notational relativity” programme.

C. I. Lewis was the student of Royce, whose book Post reads and becomes an aid in formulating at his linguistic approach to logic to arrive at string rewriting systems.

Chomsky learns of Post’s work via Rosenbloom’s book.

Negation as a rotation of polygons/polyhedra. Also gives a brief survey of different kinds of logic systems and the kind of group actions implicit in their structures.
