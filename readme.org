* Renaissance Logic

A trend as new renaissance logic emerges is the start of sustained tension and critique between new forms of logic and that of traditional scholastic logic. Certain schools such as Oxford (in the form of individuals like Aldrich, Whately) gives support to the traditional logic, while alternatives cast in the tradition of Cartesian and Lockean modes of epistemology begins to criticize syllogisms and a mutual dialogue between them can be seen in this period.

Nicholai Ivanovich Styazhkin identifies three main branches that spun off during Renaissance. The Traditional logic that remained conserved in religious institutions, reform logic of Melanchthon and Ramus, and mystical tradition beginning from Ramón Llull.

He introduced relative product which can be used to compose relations together to attain transitivity:

He also introduce ideas like newConcept = fn :: anotherConcept
where :: means a function fn applied to another concept. This is said to have possibly influenced Frege’s work.

* George Boole (1815 – 1864)

[[Boole’s portrait from his 1865 obituary][./img/boole.png]]

[[https://archive.org/details/illustratedlondov46lond/page/60/mode/2up][Image source]]

First published work of Boole in mathematics was on analysis. Fellow of Trinity College in Cambridge called Gregory would help Boole to publish this paper in Transactions of The Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1844. This paper would go on to win the society’s gold medal thereby establishing Boole’s reputation. The paper is a work on calculus of operations.

Boole was inspired to take up work in logic after seeing a dispute between De Morgan and Hamilton in one of the periodicals. He would go on to apply this calculus of operators to logic, thereby algebraizing logic and creating the domain of algebra of logic.

Boole’s logic on deductive logic is but one half with inductive logic and probability theory being the other half of his works in 1847 and 1854.

TODO: Trace if these letters of dispute between De Morgan and Hamilton is available.

** [[https://archive.org/details/mathematicalanal01bool/page/n3/mode/2up][The mathematical analysis of logic (1847)]]

His first pamphlet was called a mathematical analysis of logic, that was published on 29th October, 1847. He first sent it to Rev. Charles Graves at the Cambridge University, who approved it and is said to make some ingenious additions.

TODO: Trace what these additions where.

** Symbolic Logic (1896)

* Charles Peirce (1839 – 1914)

Peirce tried to unite the algebraic logic of Boole and quantified relational inferences of De Morgan. Peirce moved away from equational logic and tried to bring a logic of relatives.

Peirce introduced quantifiers briefly in 1870.

* Ernst Schröder (1841 – 1902)

Schröder borrowed quantifiers from Peirces for his influential treatise on the algebra of logic which was adopted by Peano from Schröder.

Cantor was working with calculus and the attempt to formalize the idea of inifinitesimals and infinities lead to the creation of set theory formalism.

* Notes

There seems to be a link between how Kempe influenced Peirce, both influenced Royce, which ends up influencing Sheffer in arriving at his “notational relativity” programme.

C. I. Lewis was the student of Royce, whose book Post reads and becomes an aid in formulating at his linguistic approach to logic to arrive at string rewriting systems.

Chomsky learns of Post’s work via Rosenbloom’s book.
