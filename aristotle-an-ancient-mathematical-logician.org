* The Modernity of Aristotle's Logical Investigations
George Boger

Brief summary
--------------

In what sense is Aristotle's logic modern? This paper gives a crisp and surface level overview without getting into the nitty gritty of the representation of syllogisms and deduction rules. In that, it is a commenable effort on the part of Boger.

Detailed review
-----------------

There are many aspects of Aristotle's logic which are modern.

Five salient features:
1) Aristotle took logic to be part of epistemology used to establish knowledge of logical consequence. The science of logic takes this as its principal concern

2) Prior Analytics is a metalogical treatise on the syllogistic deduction system. He exhaustively treated all possible combinations of argument patterns to determine which have only valid argument instances

3) Aristotle recognized the epistemic efficacy of certain elemental argument patterns having only valid instances, and formulated them as rules of natural deduction in corresponding sentences.

4) Prior Analytics is a proof-theoretic treatise in which Aristotle describes a natural deduction system and demonstrates certain logical relationships among syllogistic deduction rules. He modelled his syllogistic logic in a rudimentary way for this purpose and metasystematically established the independence of a set of deduction rules

5) Aristotle worked with a notion of substitution sufficient for distinguishing logical syntax and semantics. He also distinguished validity from deducibility sufficiently well to note the completeness of his logic.

1) Logic is taken as part of epistemology

- Made logic into a field of its own
- Topic neutral deductions
- Distinction between syllogisms and demonstrations
- Syllogisms are the valid ones. Demonstrations are the true and valid ones.
- Logic as the system used to establish true valid knowledge. It is a system that allows one to establish knowledge from the first principles of a demonstrative science.

2) Syllogistic deduction is treated metalogically

- Determined how every syllogistic is generated using inductive methods.
- The minimal 2 premise sets were examined exhaustively
- Method of Completion and Method of Contrasted Instances
- A syllogism is treated as a relatively uninterpreted object. It was treated as an elemental argument pattern with only valid argument instances.
- Employed semantic principle of form in that he established a link between argument's pattern and its validity/invalidity

3) Rules of natural deduction are explicitly formulated

- Aristotle understood the epistemic efficacy of syllogisms.
- He explicitly formulated them as rules of deduction

4) The Syllogistic System is modeled to demonstrate logical relationships among its rules
5) Logical syntax is distinguished from semantics


As a result of studies since 1920s, the genius of Aristotle as a logician of considerable originality and insght has been recognized. We can see that many aspects of his logical investigations are modern.

Traditionally, (formal) logic is concerned with the analysis of sentences or of propositions and of proof with attention to the form in abstraction from the matter. - Alonzo Church, Introduction to Mathematical Logic (1956)

Aristotle's philosophical genius is having established a formal logic and making the study of logic a science. He recognized that deductions about a given subject matter are topic specific and pertain to a given universe of discourse say geometry / arithmetic / biology, but that such deductions employ a topic neutral deduction sytem to establish knowledge of logical consequence.

1) Logic as part of epistemology

Prior Analytics established a formal deduction system that could serve as an instrument for demonstrative science, or (apodeiktikê epistêmê) as this is outlined in Posterior Analytics.

Aristotle notes that syllogisms should be discussed before demonstration because syllogisms are more universal. A demonstration is a kind of syllogism, but not every syllogism is an apodexis. 

Prior Analytics is a study of a system of formal conditions for cogent argumentations.

Aristotle treated logic as part of epistemology. In particular, he considered it to be that part used to establish knowledge that a given categorical sentence follows logically or necessarily from other given categorical sentences.

A deduction system for Aristotle is an epistemic instrument of the mind by means of which someone is able logically to derive theorems from the first principles of a demonstrative science. The study of such an instrument is focused precisely on the formal conditions of logical consequence.

2) Metalogical treatment of the Syllogistic

Aristotle attempted to determine how every syllogism is generated. He accomplished this by exhaustively treating every possible categorical argument pattern having a premise-set of 2 categorical sentence patterns with places for three different terms. They were studied because of their minimality in that "something different than what was initially taken results necessarily".

Aristotle used metalogical processes to establish the validity and invalidity of his deduction processes:
1) method of completion (teleiousthai or teleiosis). This process employs four teleioi/perfect syllogisms of the first figure as rules of deduction to establish which second and third figure argument patterns are syllogisms. Every argument with semantically precise terms fitting these patterns are valid. This process of identifying them was by treating them individually not axiomatically; his metasystematic treatment is inductive and not deductive.

2) method of contrasted instances to separate the invalid instances from the valid instances. Aristotle identified argument patterns with only invalid argument instances by this method. This treatment is also inductive and not axiomatic. This is different from the modern method of counterargument or the method of counterinterpretation found in modern logic as it invalidates argument patterns and not argument instances. It is noteworthy that there isn't even one instance of the method of counter argument in Prior Analytic A4-7.

His method of invalidating argument patterns consists in substituting two sets of 3 different terms into two argument patterns to produce 2 arguments all of whose sentence instances are true. Each argument has premises fitting the same premise-pair pattern, but one has a universal affirmative (a) sentence as a conclusion and the other a universal privative (e) sentence as conclusion. It is straightforward to adapt his method to the method of counterargument and to produce 2 arguments each with true premises and a false conclusion by switching his substitution instances. An example can be seen at A4, 26a11-13.

I think the patterns were called moods in the figure and the valid moods in the figures as syllogisms.

In this way, we get at the formal nature of the study. A syllogism then as treated in Prior Analytics is a relatively uninterpreted object. It is an elemental argument pattern with only valid argument instances. This is similar to the way in which a geometer treats triangles in the abstract than being concerned with the concrete multitude of possibilities in which they can be instantiated.

TODO: There is an interesting point that Aristotle didn't apprehend the form of the syllogisms Platonistically. I have to dig into this further.

Aristotle employed at least implicitly the semantic principle of form that two arguments having the same form fitting the same strict syllogistic pattern are both valid or both invalid. He established a relationship between an argument's pattern and its validity and invalidity. For there to be a syllogism, it is necessary and sufficient that terms be formally related as Aristotle stated in a set of rules. He formulated rules for how there not to be a syllogism, the terms be related in particular ways.

Aristotle recognized 14 syllogisms in 3 figures whereas traditional logicians or logicians referring to traditional logic, consider there to be 24 syllogisms in four figures.

3) Rules of Natural Deduction are epistemically formulated

Aristotle recognized the epistemic efficacy of syllogism, the elemental argumental patterns have the only valid instances. He formulated them explicitly as rules of deduction in corresponding sentences. In Prior Analytics A4-7, he established a set of deduction rules as part of his natural deduction system.

One process of deduction is accomplished by taking pairs of given categorical sentences to generate immediate inferences according to prescribed rules; these inferences are then added to the given sentences and then taken in pairs repeatedly until a final conclusion is reached. Aristotle treated this exactly analogous to chaining immediate inferences when using rules of propositional logic.

It is interesting to see that syllogistic process is noted to be roughly analogous to adding a series of single digit numbers until the sum is calculated. This is used to surmise that Aristotle likely incorporetd into his conception of an extended duction process, the possibility of one or more indirect deductions as nested steps.

Aristotle treated syllogisms exactly as a topic neutral rule of deduction.

4) Relationship among syllogistic rules

Prior Analytics is a proof-theoretic treatise where logical relationships among syllogistic deduction rules are explored. Aristotle modelled his syllogistic, although in a rudimentary way, to describe and study the system in order to establish theorems about system's properties. Boger is cautious when saynig that Aristotle worked in the direction of inventing an uninterpreted language. He goes so far as to say that an artificial language was developed to help model his logic better to reveal its properties and says its a stretch to claim that it is an uninterpreted language in the modern sense. It is said to be doubtful that Aristotle did this to model natural language but rather to bring rigor to scientific discourse or to model his logic.

In Prior Analytics, Aristotle's interests were not focussed on the practice of performing object language deductions but on questions that compass the foundations of deductive sciences. 

Aristotle's proof theoretic theorem concerning completion is that "all the atelês syllogisms are completed by means of the first figure syllogism using probative and reductio proofs". Teleios and ateles are epistemic terms referring to the evidency of a sentence following from other two sentences. A teleios syllogism is completed through itself and in such a case, the necessity of the conclusion following necessarily from the premises is immediately evident. In the case of an atelês syllogism, evidence of necessity is not immediate as something else is needed. Here a deduction is required to establish knowledge of logical consequence.

The method of contrasted instances has as its epistemic import to eliminate certain elemental argument patterns as rules of deduction.

Aristotle treated reduction (anagein or anagôgê) of syllogisms. This has caused difficulty for interpreters as they have confused reduction with analysis (analuein or analusis) in their zeal to axiomatize Aristotle's syllogistic. A careful reading is said to show that Aristotle's reduction is a proof-theoretic process that establishes certain rules to be rudendant or unnecessary in his deduction system. Łukasiewicz believes that he helps to illuminate Aristotle's own axiomatization of the syllogistic and J. W. Miller (1938) believes that he completed an undertaking that Aristotle himself had begun. Traditionalists have tried to deduce all the syllogisms from the dictum de omni et null, while the axiomaticists have tried variously to deduce them as theorems from others taken as axioms.

Aristotelian reduction is said to be a proof-theoretic process that establishes certain deduction rules to be edundant or unnecessary in his deduction system:. The same deductive results can be obtained by using a select number of rules. In A7, he treats the logical relationships among all the syllogisms taken as rules. Thus Aristotle was not concerned to demonstrate the validity/invalidity of a given argument or to show that a given argument pattern is a syllogism. Rather he was concerned to demonstrate that a conclusion is shown to follow for each of the established syllogism by using only the two universal teleioi syllogism as deduction rules. While the process of reducing the syllogism is metasystematic, it is nevertheless an inductive process that employs a deductive step. Aristotle tests each possible result individually and exhaustively and not axiomattically. Aristotle's theorem is that "All the syllogisms can be reduced to the two universal syllogisms in the first figure". Expressing this in modern terms, we can identify that Aristotle demonstrated the logical independence of the two universal syllogisms of the first figure.

Reduction is a deduction process that employs deduction. Aristotle at A7 performs edductions with the objective to eliminate redundant rules in order to simplify his deduction system. Aristotle demonstrated that each of the second and third figure syllogism, as well as the two particular syllogism of the first figure can be completed by using only the two universal syllogisms of the first figures as deduction rules.

At 4-6, he established the preeminence of the teleioi syllogism (first figure) among the syllogisms and implicitly established that the ateleis syllogisms of second and third figures are redundant rules in his deduction system.

5) Logical syntax and semantics are sufficiently distinguished

One suffcient way to determine whether a logician distinguishes logical syntax from semantics is to ascertain whether they work with a nation of interpretation or re-interpretation. Boger believes that Aristotle worked with neither notion. Another equally sufficient way is to determine whether they works with a nation of substitution, a process by which one changes the language, or the content words in a given argument while leaving their meanings and logical form fixed.

Aristotle pervasively used schematic letters to mark places for terms, his naming terms by their schematic positions, and his practice of substitution indicate that he distinguished between syntax and semantics.

It is curious to note that these schematic letters were not variables. It is said to be similar to Quine's meaning of "a dummy to mark a position".

I think to make it a variable, there needs to be the conception of a function, but rather, this is something more like a blank which is not acted upon by anything, but rather something is filled in. A function can surely model this, but the notion of function being absent is what doesn't make it a variable.

In Sophistical Refutations Aristotle used the word syllogisms to denote an argument that fits an argument pattern having only valid instances and he used the expression apparent syllogism to denote an argument that appears to fit such a pattern but which really fits another, non-syllogistic pattern. An example would be one with four terms as in the case of an equivocation. Thus, while a two-premise categorical argument with an equivocal term has a grammatical pattern that makes it appear to be a syllogism, but it really has a logical pattern different from a syllogism. These logical patterns were precisely Aristotle's concern in Prior Analytics and these are strictly formal and independent of a given object language. These patterns are independent of the particular use to which a given object language might be put whether as a hypothesis, or as a dialectical, a didactic, a demonstrative, or an eristic, or even a modal syllogistic argument.

Some modern mathematical logicians believe that Aristotle was not sophisticated enough to make the syntax and semantics distinction and as a result he did not define logical consequence or "following necessarily". However, in Metaphysics 5.5 there is a sophistication precisely in his defining "necessary" just as he used the concept in Prior Analytics: "that which is necessary is that having no other relationship".

He also said:
"demonstration is of necessary things, because, if there is a demonstration proper, it is not pssible for there to be any other relations; the reason for this is the premises, for if there is a syllogism, it is [logically] impossible for there to be another relationship among them."

Thus a syllogism is such that no other relationship is logically possible. This holds notwithstanding that a weakened a or e (i.e. an i or o) is a different sentence.

It is also clear that Aristotle distinguished truth from validitiy. This is evident at Prior Analytics B2-4 where he systematically treated the various possibilities of valid arguments with true and false sentences as premises and conclusions in the three figures. 

Aristotle was keenly aware of the differences between 1) establishing knowledge of the truth or falsity of a given sentence (whether by induction or deduction) and 2) establishing knowledge of the validity/invalidity of a given argument.

He also grasped the difference between the necessity in each case and in addition, also distinguished validity from deducibility.

The passage at Prior Analytics A30:

"For if nothing that truly belongs to the subjects has been left out of our collection of facts, then concerning every fact, if a demonstration for it exists, we will be able to find that demonstration and demonstrate it, while if it does not naturalyl haev a demonstration, we will be able to make that evident."

This statement points to Aristotle's concern with the practical power of his syllogistic system as an epistemic instrument for obtaining scientific knowledge. It also suggests a modern concern with the completeness of a deduction system, that is, with whether every logical consequence of a set of sentences is deducible using a set of deduction rules. 

This completeness proof in this connection has features different from that of a modern logician's proof. It is roughly captured by the modern notion of mathematical induction.

The elemental syllogistic argument patterns capture every possible valid argument having a premise-set of two sentences.

These patterns constitute along with the conversion rules, the elements of syllogistic deductive reasoning

Every extended syllogistic discourse, (sic. a deduction) is reducible to a chain of syllogisms, that is, to a chain of immediate inferences generated syllogistically.

Every valid categorical argument having more than two premises can be completed, that is, its conclusion can be deduced by generating a chain of immediate inferences, to wit, a chain of syllogisms.

Aristotle was thought to be confused, by Günther Patzig, about the distinction between "following necessarily" and "being necessary". This is not so as he distinguished between a syllogism, or a deduction, and a demonstration and also between assertoric logic and modal logic. Aristotle clearly distinguished between 1) a given sentence's following necessarily from other sentences and 2) a given sentence dennoting a state of affairs to be necessary/possible. 

Aristotle recognized that while the conclusion of a given argument follows necessarily from it spremises, this necessity may not be evident to a participant. He knew that the epistemic process of deduction produces knowledge, or makes evident, that a given sentence follows necessarily from others. He considered the product of this epistemic process to be an argumentation that includes a deductive chain of reasoning in addition to the given premises and conclusion.

Aristotle distinguished 1. the subject matter of a given argument from 2. the use to which a given argument might be put from 3. the varying expertise of a participant, all of which are distinct from 4. formal matters underlying any of them. To examine these formal matters was his project in Prior Analytics. In this connection, Aristotle distinguished two kinds of knowledge 1) knowledge of what is true/false which pertains to sentences and 2) knowledge of what is valid or invalid which pertains to arguments.

It is said to be astonishing that for hundreds of years, perhaps dating to before the Port Royal Logic, Aristotelian logic or traditional logic has been taught without a single reference to the process of deduction. It is said to have been the practice of R. Whately, W. S. Jevons, H. W. B Joseph, J. N. Keynes, R. M. Eatton, and many others. It is said to be still the practice in many introductory textbooks on categorical logic that test a syllogism according to rules of quality, quantity and distribution and entirely to overlook the deduction process of chaining syllogisms, not to mention the glaring error to take a syllogism to be either a valid or invalid argument.

Jan Łukasiewicz can be credited with shedding light on the syllogistic by examining it with the theoretical apparatus of mathematical logic. But he and his followers only 'improved' the traditionalist interpretation with a sophistication afforded by mathematical logic. Both lines of interpretation took Aristotle's presentation to be an axiomatization of the syllogistic. While traditionalists drew lines between sentences in different syllogisms to indicate their logical relationships (ther analyses or transformations), axiomaticists such as Łukasiewicz cleverly turned a syllogism into a logically true conditional proposition that could be processed by a propositional logic. This way, the axiomaticists indicated the logical relationships among the syllogisms. Again, the epistemic process of deduction was overlooked.

It was from the early 1970s, with the work of Timothy Smiley and John Corcoran that the case for Aristotle's reputation as a logician of consummate intelligence and originality became well argued. They established Aristotle to be concrened with the deduction process just as many modern mathematical logicians. Corcoran and Smiley also modelled Aristotle's logic using mathematical logic. However, instead of finding an axiomatization, they discovered a natural deduction system. Boger's interpretation builds on the work of Corcoran and Smiley and the new translation of Prior Analytics (1989) by Robin Smith and argues that Aristotle did model his own system in particular treating a syllogism as a rule of deduction at Prior Analytics A4-7, and that he himself was able proof-theoretically to determine certain properties of his deduction system refining the system by eliminating redundant rules, and affirming the system's completeness.

Material for first essay:

Since antiquity, Aristotle's logic had exchanged hands of many civilizations. Key ones that I have noticed as the Arabs to Medieval logicians to Classical philosophers to Renaissance philosophers to the modern logicians and finally to the period when mathematical logic was firmly established.

In these periods, it is noteworthy that it is quipped in Boger's essay that may be even to the period before Port Royale Logic and up until late 1960s, Aristotle's logic was taught without understanding it to be a natural deduction system was treated without explicit mention of the process of deduction.

The axiomatists attempted to 
Investigations by Timothy Smiley and Corcoran in the 1960s revealed the system to be a natural deduction system. Prior to this the axio

Material for second essay:

 A syllogism then as treated in Prior Analytics is a relatively uninterpreted object. It is an elemental argument pattern with only valid argument instances. This is similar to the way in which a geometer treats triangles in the abstract than being concerned with the concrete multitude of possibilities in which they can be instantiated. This is the hypostatization aspect touched upon in the first part of the essay.

 I think the patterns were called moods in the figure and the valid moods in the figures as syllogisms. This kind of terminology is perhaps better introduced in the second essay.

 Formal nature of Aristotle's Logic
 Aristotle employed at least implicitly the semantic principle of form that two arguments having the same form fitting the same strict syllogistic pattern are both valid or both invalid. He established a relationship between an argument's pattern and its validity and invalidity. For there to be a syllogism, it is necessary and sufficient that terms be formally related as Aristotle stated in a set of rules. He formulated rules for how there not to be a syllogism, the terms be related in particular ways.

In Woods' view, 2), 3), and 4) claims of Boger are correct but have doubts about 1) and 5).

As per Jon Barwise, Mathematical logic is traditionally divided into:
Model theory
Set theory
Recursion theory
Proof theory

By Kleen's light:
Study of mathematical logic beigns properly only in the theory of computability and decidability.
Shoenfield sees things in the same way as Barwise:
The central topics of mathematical logic are proof theory, model thery, recursion theory, axiomatic number theory, and set theory.

Woods wonders if the sort of proof theory found in Aristotle's theory of natural deduction one in the modern sense of an exercise in logical syntax.

Logical consequence enters Aristotle's account in 3 ways:
As converse of the primitive notion of necessitation or entailment.
Converse of the defined relation of syllogistic implication
Drives the non-syllogistic perfection proofs of the metalogic in the Prior Analytics.

It is noted that in no case is it discernible that consequence is an artefact of logical syntax.

As the converse of necessitation, it imbibes the overtly semantic character of that relation. As the converse of syllogistic implication, it is a restriction of a core semantic relation, even though some of the restrictions might be seen as purely syntactic constraints.

As the relation that drives the perfection proofs of the Prior analytics, it makes use of deduction rules which embed the notion of syllogistic implication.

These facts are then used to conclude that the logical consequence that there is no modern syntax-semantics in Aristotle's logic.

Aristotle's logic is in no sense a logic of validity. Its principal target is the syllogism.

Syllogisms are restrictions of valid arguments. They are valid arguments satisfying further conditions. One is that there be no idle premises, another that conclusions not repeat a premise. Third is that syllogisms have no multiple conclsions (in the manner of Gentzen). These constraints make the core theory of syllogism an intuitionistic, relevant, nonmonotonic logic.

Hintikka on Aristotle's fallacies - John Woods and Hans Hansen

Woods doubt whether Boger's comments on ARistotle having a sufficient distinction between syntax and semantics. Woods sees Aristotle's theory of syllogisms tied to a canonical language which is a strict sublanguage of Greek. He says that there is no proposition containing any expression which is not either a general term of Greek, or a symbol for predicate negation (or term complementation) or a quantifier expression. What makes categorical Greek Aristotle's choice of canonical logical notation is the thesis of propositional simplification which asserts that anything statable in Greek is statable without relevant loss in the language of [categorical] propositions. Lack of variables in the language of metalogic is also taken to be a hint that this syntax-semantics distinction is missing.

In modern terms, a natural language argument's logical form is its reconstruction in a semi-interpreted artificial language. There is nothing in Aristotle which shows such conception of logical form. Logical forms embed variables irreducibly. There are no variables in Aristotle's logic. These suggest that in Aristotle there is a lack of an implicit understanding of logical form. To the extent that there is no notion of logical form and artificial/uninterpreted canonical language, it is difficult to make the case for syntax/semantics distinction in Aristotle's logic.

Woods is doubtful of whether modern logic sees itself as part of epistemology and that Aristotle's logic can be seen as part of epistemology. Frege's second order logic has an epistemological motivation. Frege wanted to demonstrate the analyticity of arithmetic which is clearly an epistemological objective. He thought that he could fulfill it by showing that number theory can be reproducible without relevant loss in a theory of pure sets embedded in a quantification theory of second order. Both these theories he took to be analytic, bu tthere is little in Frege that counts as a case for this assumption. In like fashion, constructionist logics are dirven by a certain conception of the conditions under which mathematical knowledge is possible for us. It is one thing to have an epistemological motivation and another to be part of epistemology.

When designing a course, in Woods' opinion, we might include writings characteristic of the main positions in the theory of knowledge, both historically and contemporaneously. It would have referrals to correspondenc/coherenc theories to pragmatic theories, to internalism/externalism, to naturalism/reliabilism, to the problem of a priori knowledge, to the nature of evidence and justification. But would we direct the student to a system of logic? Woods does not think so. By modern standards, logic is said to be not a part of epistemology. Heidegger is said to be an exception. He says logic is the conditions of knowing in general.

This is similar to that of certain informal logicians like Harvey Siegel and John Biro in "Epistemic Normativity, Argumentation, and Fallacies", Mark Weinstein in "Entailment in Argumentation" and James Freeman in "An Unrecognized Part of the Informal Program".

By reading Topics and Sophistical Refutations, we see that Aristotle wanted logic to be the theoretical core of a wholly general theory of argument, but with Prior Analytics, the objective narrowed and Aristotle sought a tehory of demonstration of which he deferred the development to the Posterior Analytics.

As conceived of by Aristotle, demonstrations embed two epistemological significant notions - of first principles and the idea of certainty. Though, Woods says that the theoretical accounts of these things are missing in his work.

Of first principles, one learns that they neither require nor admit of demonstration. And of certainty, we learn that demonstrations preserve truth but not certainty. So Woods claims that it is a substantial overstatement to claim that Aristotle's logic is a part of epistemology.

For the rest of the three points, Woods has admiration and support for Boger and that these are far and away the most important points on which Aristotle's reputation as a logician of astonishing prescience is secured.
